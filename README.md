Worked on making the main menu, making sure that it works correctly and takes you to the right places.

working on checks on the main menu and then going to plan the first tutorial.
First tutorial will be on making a seesaw platform in a 2d game, I plan to make it by having two colliders that change the rotation of the platform as suggested by a person on the unity forums here (https://discussions.unity.com/t/how-do-you-tilt-a-platform-depending-on-what-side-your-player-is-standing/175194/3). It says to use OnTriggerStay to make the platform tilt while the player is on a half of the platform, you could probably simulate weight by having smaller sections that half that increase the amount of rotation depending where you are on the platform.
    
Another user in the same post wrote a comment saying to use a hinge point and the 2d physics (https://discussions.unity.com/t/how-do-you-tilt-a-platform-depending-on-what-side-your-player-is-standing/175194/4).
    
Im going to attempt to make the physics based on but i will also make the collider version as a backup option.
